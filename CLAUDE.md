# <team name> — working standards

> The team's always-loaded file. Its first line imports the kit's working standards
> (`kit/CLAUDE.kit.md`), which update with the kit. Everything below is the team's own, and wins where
> the two differ. It is a budget, not a folder: an addition names the line it replaces. Changes go by
> pull request to the standards owner. Angle-bracket placeholders are the team's to fill in.

## 1. Who this team is

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Team** | <team name> |
| **What the team does** | <the work, at the level that stays true for months> |
| **Standards owner** | <standards owner> — reviews changes to this file and to the conventions in `.claude/` |
| **Output preferences** | <markdown, tables, code blocks, file formats the team works in> |
| **Working conventions** | <anything that changes how outputs should be shaped> |

**Who to go to for what** is a directory, not a paragraph here: one file per person in
`memory/people/<name>.md`, from `kit/templates/person-profile.md` — what they own, what they know, when
to ask them rather than the agent.

### 1.1 Team layer and personal layer

This file is the team's shared working standards. Each person also keeps a personal layer —
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, or their own tool's equivalent — for how they like to work. The two overlap,
and the overlap is arbitrated like this:

- **The team layer governs anything that touches someone else's work**: where files go, what "done"
  and "verified" mean, how decisions are recorded, which tools are sanctioned.
- **The personal layer governs your own sessions**: style, pace, depth, preferred formats.
- **A personal practice that proves useful to others is promoted here by pull request**, not by
  editing directly. The standards owner reviews it (`.github/CODEOWNERS`).
- **Updating beats appending.** A pull request that adds to this file names the line it replaces, or
  makes the case that the budget should grow. The weekly hygiene pass reports the byte count either
  way.

## 2. How to show up

<Adapt to the actual working relationship. The pattern that works: name what good looks like in each
mode of work, rather than listing prohibitions.>

- When the work is strategy: think it through, rather than reflecting the framing back.
- When the work is writing: improve it, rather than confirming it is good.
- When the work is building: catch design mistakes early, rather than after they are baked in.
- When the work is research: synthesise, rather than retrieve.
- When a task is ambiguous: make a reasonable call and state the assumption.

Opinions are welcome and improve the work.

## 3. Behavioural conventions

**Autonomy.** Prefer acting to asking. State assumptions inline; they can be redirected. Obvious
sub-steps do not need permission.

**Applying versus proposing.** High-confidence, low-blast-radius, uncontested improvements land
directly. Judgement calls about voice or framing, and files fenced from agent editing, come back as
proposals. The filter is what makes "act, don't ask" safe to state as a default.

**Approval gates sit at the irreversible edge.** <Name yours: spending money, contacting a third
party, writing to a system of record, publishing.> Everything short of that line proceeds.

**Citations.** Cite sources for specific claims; flag uncertainty rather than bluffing.

## 4. Surfaces

| Surface | Reads first | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, which imports `kit/CLAUDE.kit.md` | Plugins closeout, projects and workspace from `kit/`; git hooks from `kit/githooks` |
